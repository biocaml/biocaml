val iter2_exn : 'a t -> 'b t -> f:('a -> 'b -> unit) -> unit
(** [iter2_exn a b ~f] calls in turn [f a1 b1], [f a2 b2], ... [f an
    bn]. @raise Expected_streams_of_equal_length if the two
    streams have different lengths, and no guarantee about which
    elements were consumed. *)

(** Same as [iter2_exn] except that it doesn't raise an exception if

(** [exists e ~f] returns [true] if there is some [x] in [e] such
    that [f x]*)

val for_all: 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool
(** [for_all e ~f] returns [true] if for every [x] in [e], [f x] is true*)

val fold : 'a t -> init:'b -> f:('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'b
(** [fold xs ~init ~f] returns [f (...(f (f init x1) x2)...) xn] *)

val reduce : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'a -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [reduce xs ~f] returns [f (...(f (f x1 x2) x3)...) xn] *)

(** [sum xs] returns the sum of the integers contained in [xs] *)

val fsum : float t -> float 
(** [fsum xs] returns the sum of the floats contained in [xs] *)

(** [fold2_exn xs ys ~init ~f] returns [f (...(f (f init x1 y1) x2

    and [ys] have different lengths. *)

val fold2 : 'a t -> 'b t -> init:'c -> f:('c -> 'a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c
(** Same as [fold2_exn] except that it doesn't raise an exception if
    the two streams have different lengths. *)

val scanl : 'a t -> init:'b -> f:('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'b t
(** A variant of [fold] producing a stream of its intermediate
    values.  If [e] contains [x0], [x1], ..., [scanl f init e] is
    the stream containing [init], [f init x0], [f (f init x0) x1],
    [f (f (f init x0) x1) x2], ... *)

val scan : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'a -> 'a) -> 'a t
  (** [scan] is similar to [scanl] but without the [init] value: if [e]
      contains [x0], [x1], [x2] ..., [scan e ~f] is the enumeration containing
      [x0], [f x0 x1], [f (f x0 x1) x2]...

      For instance, [scan (1 -- 10) ~f:( * )] will produce an enumeration
      containing the successive values of the factorial function.*)


(** Indexed variants of the previous higher-order functions. The index
    provided to the [~f] argument is the count of the stream, that is
    the number of discarded elements before the reaching the current
    one. For functions iterating on two streams, the [~f] is thus
    provided two indices, since the current count may differ from one
    stream to another. *)

val find : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a option
(** [find e ~f] returns either [Some x] where [x] is the first
    element of [e] such that [f x] returns [true], consuming the
    stream up to and including the found element, or [None] if no
    such element exists in the stream, consuming the whole stream in
    the search.

    Since [find] (eagerly) consumes a prefix of the stream, it
    can be used several times on the same stream to find the
    next element. *)


val find_exn : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a
(** Same as [find] except that it raises an exception [Not_found]
    instead of returning [None]. *)

val find_map : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'b option) -> 'b option
(** Similar to [find] *)

val next: 'a t -> 'a option
val next_exn: 'a t -> 'a
val is_empty : 'a t -> bool

(** {6 Prefix and suffix} *)

val take : int -> 'a t -> 'a t
(** [take n xs] builds a fresh stream from [xs] containing the [d]
    first elements of [xs] where [d = min n l] and [l] is the length
    of [xs]. As it is fresh, the count of the resulting stream starts
    from [0] whatever the count of [xs] is. *)

val take_while : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t
(** Same as [take] but takes elements from the input enum as long as
    [f] evaluates to [true]. 
*)

val drop : int -> 'a t -> unit
(** [drop n xs] is equivalent to calling [n] times [junk] on [xs]. *)

val drop_while : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> unit
(** Similar to [drop]: [drop_while xs ~f] removes elements from [xs]
    and stops when [f] evals to false on the head element. *)

val skip : int -> 'a t -> 'a t
(** Similar to [drop] but returns a fresh stream obtained after
    discarding the [n] first elements. Being a fresh stream, the count
    of the returned stream starts from 0. Beware though, that the
    input and output streams are consuminmg the same resource, so
    consuming one modify the other. *)

val skip_while : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t
(** Similar to [skip]: [skip_while xs ~f] removes elements from [xs]
    and stops when [f] evals to false on the head element. *)


(** Indexed variants of the previous prefix/suffix constructors *)
val take_whilei : 'a t -> f:(int -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a t

val skip_whilei : 'a t -> f:(int -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a t


val span : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t * 'a t
(** [span test e] produces two streams [(hd, tl)], such that
    [hd] is the same as [take_while test e] and [tl] is the same
    as [skip_while test e]. *)

val group : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'b) -> 'a t t
(** [group xs f] applies [f] to the elements of [xs] and distribute
    them according to the return value of [f]. Let [ys] = [group xs
    f], then [xs] = [concat ys] and in each stream [s] of [ys], all
    values give the same value with [f]. *)

val group_by : 'a t -> eq:('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a t t
(** Same as [group] but with a comparison function instead of a
    mapping. *)

val filter : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t

val append : 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
val concat : 'a t t -> 'a t

val combine : 'a t * 'b t -> ('a * 'b) t
(** [combine] transforms a pair of streams into a stream of pairs of
    corresponding elements. If one stream is short, excess elements
    of the longer stream are ignored. *)

val uncombine : ('a * 'b) t -> 'a t * 'b t
  (** [uncombine] is the opposite of [combine] *)

val merge : 'a t -> 'a t -> cmp:('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a t
  (** [merge test (a, b)] merge the elements from [a] and [b] into a
      single stream. At each step, [test] is applied to the first
      element of [a] and the first element of [b] to determine which
      should get first into the resulting stream. If [a] or [b]
      runs out of elements, the process will append all elements of
      the other stream to the result.  *)

val partition : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t * 'a t
  (** [partition e ~f] splits [e] into two streams, where the first
      stream have all the elements satisfying [f], the second stream
      is opposite. The order of elements in the source stream is
      preserved. *)

val uniq : 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [uniq e] returns a duplicate of [e] with repeated values
      omitted. (similar to unix's [uniq] command) *)

val range : ?until:int -> int -> int t
  (** [range p until:q] creates a stream of integers [[p, p+1, ..., q]].
      If [until] is omitted, the enumeration is not bounded. Behaviour is
      not-specified once [max_int] has been reached.*)

  (** Convert exception-less stream to exception-ful
      stream. Resulting stream raises exception at first error
      seen. *)

    (** [(a, step) --. b)] creates a float enumeration from [a] to [b] with an
        increment of [step] between elements.

        [(5.0, 1.0) --. 10.0] is the enumeration 5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,10.0.
        [(10.0, -1.0) --. 5.0] is the enumeration 10.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,5.0.
        [(10.0, 1.0) --. 1.0] is the empty enumeration. *)

  val ( --- ) : int -> int -> int t
