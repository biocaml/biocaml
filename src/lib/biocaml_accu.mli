(** 
    A datastructure (based on Hashtbl) to accumulate values.

    An [Accu.t] can be seen as a generalized histogram: values 
    are mapped to bins, and each bin has a corresponding value
    which may be its size or its contents depending on the need.

(** {7 Generic API} *)

type ('instance,'bin,'increment,'accu) t
(** General type for accumulators: ['instance]s are mapped to ['bin]s, 
    and the ['accu]mulated value for a ['bin] is updated with an 
    ['increment] *)

val create : ?n:int -> 'd -> ('a -> 'b) -> ('c -> 'd -> 'd) -> ('a,'b,'c,'d) t
(** [create ~n e f op] creates an accumulator, which maps instances to bins
    with [f], uses [e] as a neutral element (that is the value associated to a 
    bin before any value has been added to it) and updates the value of a bin 
    with [op]. [n] is an estimation of the maximum number of bins. *)

val add : ('a,'b,'c,'d) t -> 'a -> 'c -> unit
(** [add accu x y] updates the value in [accu] for
    the bin of [x] by an increment [y] *)

val stream : ('a,'b,'c,'d) t -> ('b * 'd) Stream.t

val get : ('a,'b,'c,'d) t -> 'b -> 'd option
(** [get accu x] returns the value associated to [b] in [accu]. *)

  ('c * int) Stream.t 
(** [product filter f l1 l2] computes an histogram of values returned by f
    when it is applied for all combinations of elements in [l1] and
    [l2] such that the predicate [filter] is true *)

(** {7 Relation} *)

type ('a, 'b) relation = ('a,'a,'b,'b list) t

module Relation : sig
