(** A line is simply a string, possibly empty, that does not contain a
    newline character. As the name suggests, usually such strings are
    obtained by reading a file line by line. *)

(** [string_to_lines s] splits [s] on newline characters, returning
    the resuling list of lines. The returned bool is true if the final
    line ended with a newline, or false otherwise. *)

(** Return the given string without checking that it is a line. Useful
    for efficiency reasons if you're certain the given string is a
    line. *)
