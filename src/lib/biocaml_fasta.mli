(** FASTA files.

    The FASTA family of file formats has different incompatible descriptions
    ({{:https://www.proteomecommons.org/tranche/examples/proteomecommons-fasta/fasta.jsp
    }1},
    {{:http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/FASTA/}2},
    {{:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format}3}, etc.).
    
    Roughly FASTA files are in the format:

    {v
    # comment
    # comment
    ...
    >header
    sequence
    >header
    sequence
    ...
    v}

    where the sequence may span multiple lines, and a ';' may be used
    instead of '#' to start comments.
    
    Header lines begin with the '>' character. It is often considered
    that all characters until the first whitespace define the {i name}
    of the content, and any characters beyond that define additional
    information in a format specific to the file provider.
    
    Sequence are most often a sequence of characters denoting
    nucleotides or amino acids. However, sometimes FASTA files provide
    quality scores, either as ASCII encoded, e.g. as supported by
    modules {!module: Biocaml_phredScore} and {!module:
    Biocaml_solexaScore}, or as space-separated integers.

    Thus, the FASTA format is really a family of formats with a fairly
    loose specification of the header and content formats. The only
    consistently followed meaning of the format is:

    - the file can begin with comment lines that begin with a '#' or
    ';' character and/or all white-space lines

    - the header lines begins with the '>' character, is followed
    optionally by whitespace, and then contains some string

    - each header line is followed by a sequence of characters or
    space-separated integers, often just one line but allowed to span
    multiple lines

    - and this alternating pair of header/sequence lines can occur
    repeatedly.

(** Lowest level items parsed by this module:

    - `comment _ - a single comment line without the final newline

    - `header _ - a single header line without the initial '>',
    whitespace following this, nor final newline

    - `partial_sequence _ - Either a sequence of characters, represented as a
    string, or a sequence of space separated integers, represented by
    an [int list]. The value does not necessarily carry the complete
    content associated with a header. It may be only part of the
    sequence, which can be useful for files with large sequences
    (e.g. genomic sequence files). *)
