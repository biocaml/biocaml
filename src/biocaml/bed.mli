(** BED data. A BED file is in the format shown below, where columns
    must be separted by a tab character.

    {v
    chrA   lo1   hi1
    chrA   lo2   hi2
    .      .     .
    .      .     .
    .      .     .
    chrB   lo1   hi1
    chrB   lo2   hi2

    The definition is that intervals are zero based and half-open. So by
    default the line "chrA lo hi" is parsed to the interval [\[lo + 1,
    hi\]] on chromosome [chrA]. Similarly, when printing, the default
    is to print [\[lo - 1, hi\]]. The optional argument
    [increment_lo_hi] allows changing this behavior for non-conformant
    files. In addition, the optional argument [chr_map] is a [string
    -> string] function that allows changing of the chromosome name to
    a specified format, and defaults to [identity].

    Some tools require that the set of intervals do not overlap within
    each chromosome. This is not enforced, but you can use
    [any_overlap] to verify this property when needed.
