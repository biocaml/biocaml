Installing
==========

Quickstart
----------
Uncompress the source archive, go to the root of the
package, then run

    ocaml setup.ml -configure
    ocaml setup.ml -build
    ocaml setup.ml -doc
    ocaml setup.ml -install

Additional Details
------------------
For each of the above commands, add --help to see additional
options. In particular, unless you are installing as root, you will
likely need to set --bindir in the -configure step. For example

    ocaml setup.ml -configure --bindir ~/bin

The -doc step can be omitted if you do not need to generate
documentation. If you do generate it, the root of the API
documentation is [here](doclib.docdir/index.html). Documentation is
not part of the -install step. Simply copy the directory elsewhere if
you wish.

Makefile:
Support for make is provided for those who prefer it. Commands
corresponding directly to the ones above are available.

Otags:
Run 'make otags' to generate a TAGS file for use emacs or vi/vim. In
this case, you will also need the otags tool to be installed in your
path.


Uninstalling
============

Go to the root of the package, and run

    ocaml setup.ml -uninstall
