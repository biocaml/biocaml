Installing
==========
Uncompress the source archive, go to the root of the package, then run

    ocaml setup.ml -configure
    ocaml setup.ml -build
    ocaml setup.ml -install

For each of the above commands, add --help to see additional options.

Compile documentation with

    ocaml setup.ml -doc

The root of the API documentation will be
[here](doclib.docdir/index.html).

A few command line executables are provided. To build them, be sure to
pass the --enable-apps option to -configure above. In this case, the
apps will also be built when you run -build.

To run tests, be sure to pass the --enable-tests option to -configure
above. Then run

    ocaml setup.ml -test


GNU Style Build
---------------
A configure script and Makefile are provided if you prefer a
traditional GNU style build system. You can use them instead of the
above commands, but the options for configuring may not be as
complete.

Tags
----
Run 'make TAGS' to generate a TAGS file for use with emacs or
vi/vim. In this case, you will also need the otags tool to be
installed in your path.
