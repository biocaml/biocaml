(** Ranges of contiguous integers (integer intervals). A range is a
    contiguous sequence of integers from a lower bound to an upper
    bound. For example, [\[2, 10\]] is the set of integers from 2 through
    10, inclusive of 2 and 10. *)

type t = private { lo : int; hi : int } [@@deriving compare, sexp]
(** Type of a range. *)

val make : int -> int -> t Or_error.t
(** [make lo hi] returns the range [{lo; hi}]. Return [Error] if [lo >
    hi]. *)

val make_unsafe : int -> int -> t

val size : t -> int
(** [size v] returns the number of integers in [v], i.e. [v.hi - v.lo
    + 1]. *)

val member : t -> int -> bool
(** [member t k] returns true if [t] contains [k]. *)

val to_string : t -> string
(** String representation of an range, intended only for human
    legibility. *)

val to_list : t -> int list
(** [to_list v] returns the set of integers contained in [v], in
    ascending order. *)

val overlap : t -> t -> int
(** [overlap u v] returns amount of overlap between two ranges. A
    positive value indicates number of integers common to [u] and
    [v]. A negative value indicates the number of integers in between
    non-overlapping ranges. A zero value means the ranges are exactly
    adjacent to each other. The relation is symmetric. *)

val gap : t -> t -> int
(** [gap u v] returns the size of the gap between [u] and [v]. It is
    equivalent to the negative of [overlap]. *)

(** {6 Set Operations} *)

val union : t -> t -> [ `Joint of t | `Disjoint of t * t ]
(** [union u v] returns the range(s) representing the union of [u] and
    [v]. If [u] and [v] overlap, their union can be represented as a
    single range. If not, their union is a disjoint combination of two
    ranges. *)

val intersect : t -> t -> t option
(** [intersect u v] returns the range representing the intersection of
    [u] and [v]. Return None if intersection is empty. *)

(** {6 Positional Range}
    Positional means an range is viewed as coming either before or
    after another.
*)

val before : t -> t -> bool
(** [before u v] is true if [strict_before u v || equal u v]. *)

val after : t -> t -> bool
(** [after u v] is equivalent to [before v u]. *)

val strict_before : t -> t -> bool
(** [strict_before u v] is true if [u.lo < v.lo && u.hi < v.hi]. *)

val strict_after : t -> t -> bool
(** [strict_after u v] is equivalent to [strict_before v u]. *)

val compare_positional : t -> t -> int option
(** [compare_positional u v] returns -1 if [u] is strictly before [v],
    0 if [u] is equal to [v], +1 if [u] is strictly after [v], and returns
    None otherwise. *)

(** {6 Containment Range}
    Containment means a range is viewed as being inside, or a subset
    of, another.
*)

val subset : t -> t -> bool
(** [subset u v] is true if [u] is a subset of [v]. *)

val superset : t -> t -> bool
(** [superset u v] is true if [u] is a superset of [v]. *)

val strict_subset : t -> t -> bool
(** [strict_subset u v] is true if [u] is a strict subset of [v]. *)

val strict_superset : t -> t -> bool
(** [strict_superset u v] is true if [u] is a strict superset of
    [v]. *)

val compare_containment : t -> t -> int option
(** [compare_containment u v] returns -1 if [u] is a strict subset of
    [v], 0 if [u] is equal to [v], +1 if [u] is a strict superset of [v],
    and returns None otherwise. *)

(** {6 Range Lists} *)

val any_overlap : t list -> bool
(** Return true if any pair of given ranges overlap each other. *)

val all_positional : t list -> bool
(** Return true if all pairs of given ranges are positionally
    comparable. *)

val max_gap_of_positional : t list -> int
(** Return maximum gap between adjacent pairs of given ranges. Raise
    [Failure] if any pairs of given ranges not positionally comparable, or
    if given less than two ranges. *)

(** {6 More Specialized Operations} *)

val find_min_range :
  ?init_direction:string -> t -> (t -> bool) -> int -> t option
(** [find_min_range v pred i] finds the minimum sized range within [v]
    centered around [i] that satisfies [pred]. Successively larger ranges
    are created starting from \[i, i\] and the first one to satisfy [pred]
    is returned. None is returned if the given range [v] itself is reached
    and [pred] still fails. Raise [Failure] if [i] not within [v].

    The first range tried is \[i, i\], by default the second is \[i,
    i+1\], the third \[i-1, i+1\], the fourth \[i-1, i+2\], and so
    on. The optional [init_direction] must be either "fwd" or
    "rev". If "fwd", which is the default, the range size is initially
    increased in the forward direction. If "rev", the second range
    tried will be \[i-1, i\]. If the range boundary is reached on
    either side, the size continues to be increased by incrementing on
    the opposing side. *)

val expand_assoc_list : (t * 'a) list -> (int * 'a list) list
(** [exp_assoc_list dat] returns a list associating each integer [i]
    with the list of values associated with all ranges overlapping [i] in
    [dat]. The set of integers considered is the union of all in given
    [dat]. *)

val find_regions : ?max_gap:int -> ('a -> bool) -> (t * 'a) list -> t list
(** TO DO: fill in this documentation. For now see
    {!Math.find_regions}. *)

val make_random : t -> t
(** [make_random t] returns a random range that is a subset of
    [t]. May raise [Failure] if given range bounds exceed largest value
    handled by [Random] module. *)
