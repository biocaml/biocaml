(** Range on a sequence, where the sequence is represented by an identifier.

    This datatype can be used to represent genomic regions with a
    triplet (chromosome, start, end) as can be found in say, BED
    files. The {! Seq_range.Make} functor offers some genericity for the choice
    of the type representing a sequence identifier, while the module
    offers the most frequent case when the identifier is a simple
    string.

    Most operations on {! Seq_range.t} are simple extensions
    of operations on {! Range.t}.
