(** Parse given composite file. Exons belonging to same transcript, as

(** Parse given BED file. Each line is treated as a unique transcript

    [of_composite_file] but the name is always the empty string. *)

(** [of_gff f gff] converts [gff] to a list of [transcript]s. Function
    [f] will be applied to each row in [gff]. If the row is an exon it
    should return the name of the transcript to which that exon belongs,
    which will be used to group exons. It should return None if the row is
    not an exon or if you want to skip that row for any other reason. The
    [info] in the answer is the name of the transcript. Raise [Failure] if
    [f] does anything erroneous such as map exons on different chromosomes
