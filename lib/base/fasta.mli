(** FASTA files. The FASTA family of file formats has different
    incompatible descriptions
    ({{:https://www.proteomecommons.org/tranche/examples/proteomecommons-fasta/fasta.jsp
    }1}, {{:http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/FASTA/}2},
    {{:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format}3},
    {{:http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blastcgihelp.shtml}4},
    etc.). Roughly FASTA files are in the format:

    {v
    # comment
    # comment
    ...
    >description
    sequence
    >description
    sequence
    ...
    v}

    Comment lines are allowed at the top of the file. Usually comments
    start with a '#' but sometimes with a ';' character. The {!fmt}
    properties allow configuring which is allowed during parsing and
    printing.

    Description lines begin with the '>' character. Various
    conventions are used for the content but there is no
    requirement. We simply return the string following the '>'
    character.

    Sequences are most often a sequence of characters denoting
    nucleotides or amino acids, and thus an [item]'s [sequence] field
    is set to a string. Sequences may span multiple lines.

    However, sequence lines sometimes are used to provide quality
    scores, either as space separated integers or as ASCII encoded
    scores. To support the former case, we provide the
    {!sequence_to_int_list} function. For the latter case, see modules
    [Phred_score] and [Solexa_score].

    FASTA files are used to provide both short sequences and very big
    sequences, e.g. a genome. In the latter case, the main API of this
    module, which returns each sequence as an in-memory string, might
    be too costly. Consider using instead the {!Parser0} module which
    does not merge multiple sequence lines into one string. This API
    is slightly more difficult to use but perhaps a worthwhile
    trade-off.

    Format Specifiers:

    Variations in the format are controlled by the following settings,
    all of which have a default value. These properties are combined
    into the {!fmt} type for convenience and the defaults into
    {!default_fmt}.

    - [allow_sharp_comments]: Allow comment lines beginning with a '#'
    character. Default: true.

    - [allow_semicolon_comments]: Allow comment lines beginning with a
    ';' character. Default: false.

    Setting both [allow_sharp_comments] and [allow_semicolon_comments]
    allows both. Setting both to false disallows comment
    lines.

    - [allow_empty_lines]: Allow lines with only whitespace anywhere in
    the file. Default: false.

    - [max_line_length]: Require sequence lines to be shorter than given
    length. None means there is no restriction. Note this does not
    restrict the length of an [item]'s [sequence] field because this
    can span multiple lines. Default: None.

    - [alphabet]: Require sequence characters to be at most those in
    given string. None means any character is allowed. Default: None.

(** Low-level parsing

    This module provides a function that can be used to convert a
    stream of strings (representing consecutive chunks of a FASTA
    file) into a valid sequence of low-level items ({!items0}). This
    representation is especially relevant to deal with very long
    sequences (like chromosome) in constant memory.
